The beer’s haze comes from a combination of yeast and proteins within the malt, oats, and wheat with which it’s brewed.\n\nCenturies ago, witbiers were brewed with what Belgian farmers had on hand—namely, a large portion of wheat and oats. Un-roused, the beer will actually appear darker, as the light sediment settles to the bottom. However, once these solids are in suspension—the beer has been moved around a bit—the beer’s color lightens up to its traditional hue of pale straw. This haze also adds to the mouthfeel, giving the beer a silky, almost pillowy texture.\n\nTo experience the haze at its full potential, we encourage everyone with a bottle of Allagash White to rouse their yeast.",

Today, we still insist on using traditional methods, like triple decoction and parallel brewing in wooden lagering barrels. It takes longer but means we never compromise on our taste.\n\nPilsner Urquell’s signature flavour balances sweetness from the triple-decocted malt, and bitterness from our Saaz hops. The thick head of dense wet foam adds smoothness and seals in flavour and aroma.\n\nIn every sip of Pilsner Urquell you’ll notice a refreshing crispness from natural carbonation, then subtle caramel tones and a clean finish with a pleasing hoppy bitterness.",

The hard water found in the region played a special role in producing this specialty. In his book “Beer International”, the world-renowned English beer writer, Michael Jackson, accurately describes the Ayinger “Altbairisch Dunkel” as: “A good example of its kind. Impenetrably dark with a golden-brown gleam when held up to the light, and with a warm aroma and malty taste, while summoning up coffee taste sensations on going down. It is brewed from five types of malt (two of which are torrified dark), and it is only lightly hopped.” It is produced using the traditional double fermentation process",

The beer is highly fermented and therefore smooth on the initial taste sensation, but also mild and sparkling in body. Our pils is accentuated by the floweriness of the hops aroma and has a more pronounced bitterness on swallowing, which quickly fades from the taste buds.",

Simply subtract 20 years from the “best before” date!\n\nThe soft, mildly sour berry taste, harmonises with the oak barrels’ aromas in which Geuze Mariage Parfait has ripen.

    "Description": "This crisp and light white comes from the Cantine Volpi winery based in Lombardy in Northern Italy and is made from 100% Pinot Grigio grapes. Pinot Grigio is one of the world's most popular grapes and is also known under the French name of Pinot Gris. Something of a chameleon of a grape, Pinot Grigio is produced in a range of styles from the light, fruity Italian style that has gained such enormous popularity, to a more mineral, flinty rich wine favoured by the French, particularly in Alsace. This classic example of the grape is crisp and fresh and makes for a great accompaniment to grilled fish and light pasta dishes.\n\nA very pale yellow in colour with green flecks. Aromas of green herbs, citrus fruits and green pepper. Bone-dry and refreshing on the palate with a sprightly acidity and a short yet clean finish. Try with pumpkin ravioli with sage butter, spaghetti with anchovy and oregano sauce or grilled trout stuffed with rosemary, thyme and garlic.",

Away from the rigours of the appellation, in 2004 we planted the grape varieties which they felt would be the best suited, those most able to reveal the expression and the qualities of our Brugairolles sandstone terroir. Cabernet Franc and Chenin Blanc, rarely grown in the region, originate from the Loire Valley, home of Winemaker Vincent Chansault. \n\nOpaque, perfumed with fragrant black cherry, cassis and spice. Full bodied, intense with countless layers of flavour including blackcurrant, cedar and graphite. Dense fruit on the palate is bound by a structure of fine grained tannins and a lively acidity.

    "Description": "Belgian IPA - 8.3% abv\n\nTwo inflammatory words...one wild drink. Nectar imprisoned in a bottle. An anything-but-delicate blend of sharp hoppiness and fruity aroma, this beer is a life-changing backyard knife-fight for your palate. Once you’ve had a Raging Bitch, everything else pales in comparison. Fermented with a volcano-like Belgian yeast strain called “El Diablo,” Raging Bitch earned its polarizing name from the aggressively active nature of the yeast—unleashed, untamed, unbridled...and in heat. Enjoy its golden glow and white foaming head alongside bold flavors like spicy BBQ wings, blue cheese salads, or that bag of family-sized Cool Ranch Doritos you’re going to destroy later while binge-watching Netflix",

That’s a long time ago. Belgium was still part of the Netherlands and the Netherlands still had plenty of colonies. And as true tourists the Dutch often brought wonderful and odd things over from their excursions abroad. So it came to pass that exotic spices became readily available in our parts. All to the benefit of our beloved monks.\n\nHistorical sources tell us that the first wheat beer was incredibly sour. That is until the Hoegaarden monks started experimenting with orange peel and coriander from the colony Curaçao: a divine discovery that led to the world famous Hoegaarden recipe.\n\nWheat beer caused a bit of a stir in Hoegaarden, Belgium. In all honesty, Hoegaarden became one big brewery in the 18th century. In 1709, the village had no less than 12 breweries. In 1726, that number had increased to 36. Oh and let’s not forget the 110 malt houses.\n\nThe last brewery in Hoegaarden, Tomsin, closed shop in 1957. Soon after, in 1965, the villagers decided to take action to preserve the original recipe. Milkman Pierre Celis took the bull by the horns and started brewing up a batch in his milk shed, using only a copper boiler. He quickly expanded his operation and moved into a bigger building – ‘De Kluis’ (The Vault) – a subtle nod to the monks. By 1985 the nod was no longer subtle as he was making more than 75.000 hectolitres per year. Just as he was about to start exporting to the United States, a rather large fire flattened his dreams (and the beer). The brewery was destroyed.\n\nThe original Belgian wheat beer could and would not be lost. Today, 9 out of 10 wheat beers sold in Belgium are from Hoegaarden. Meanwhile, the unique flavour is being appreciated and awarded throughout Europe, North America, Australia, Singapore and China. How they pronounce the name in other parts of the world is another story. But, to set the record straight, it’s pronounced “WHOgaarden.",

The abbey’s Father Abbot Nys became acquainted with Albert Lootvoet, a master brewer.? Passionate about the future of the brewery, Father Nys was upset to have to witness how, since the unpleasant stay of the French revolutionaries, the brewery had slowly fallen into decline and had eventually had to close its doors in 1809. Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour…and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond – a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed.\n\nLeffe Blond is the flagship of Leffe. The unique recipe is the fruit of centuries of experience in the art of brewing, which brings a broad palette of aromas into balance. It is elegant, smooth and fruity, and it has a spicy aftertaste with a hint of bitter orange. Its light, sunny colour is due to the use of pale malt. Leffe Blond contains 6.6 % alcohol and fits excellently with a wide variety of dishes. It is best at a temperature of 5° to 6° Celsius. A thirst-quenching aperitif, for those relaxing moments with friends and family.",

After giving the subject some serious thought, the monks come to the idea to purify the water through a process they knew only too well: by turning it into beer. ?Before long, the inhabitants of Dinant have the pleasure of discovering a deep, dark brown beer, and thousands of pilgrims passing through are more than happy to sample the monks’ hospitality. Leffe Brown was born.\n\nLeffe Brown’s soft, deep brown colour and the perfect balance between a discreetly bitter yet slightly caramelised taste can be ascribed to age-old traditions. Hints of coffee and chocolate provide this beer with an even more desirable flavour. Served in a Leffe chalice, the smooth, creamy beer head, the roasted aromas and the spiced flavour have the ability to suspend time.",

    "Description": "Traditionally brewed for the Octoberfest in Munich, the term ‘Wiesen’ in Germany means meadow, and it is a slang term for Octoberfest. Many years ago, the beer brewed for Octoberfest was not necessarily the standard Marzen style lager beer associated with the event today. At this time, there were many styles of beer brewed there. The festival was in October rather than September, and it was often quite cold out, making necessary richer and stronger beers. Thus, Schneider’s Wiesen Edel-Weisse was made to be warming. It was quite full bodied, as the malt contained a fair amount of unfermentable sugar. In order to balance such a beer, it had to be brewed with more hops for balance, resulting in more noticeable hop character than is usually found in Weissbiers.\n\nBy law, German brewers must have their production facility in Munich in order to participate in the Octoberfest. Thus, Schneider had to leave the Octoberfest in 1942 when their Munich brewery was destroyed in the war. Fortunately, they chose to re-create the style for the American market.\n\nOne obstacle to such a re-creation has been the fact that the brewery can not buy the same type of malt as it did in 1942. This malt was essentially a crude variety which is no longer produced. However, the brewmaster did find some wheat and barley malts that can approximate the former taste. Also, changes in the hop profile have been made as a result of the brewmaster’s discovery of Cascade hops on a trip to the US. The resulting beer is stronger, lighter in color, and hoppier than Schneider Weisse. Also, the malt flavors are a bit different from those found in Schneider Weisse. Of course, they are soft, but also, quite bready and a bit perfumy/meadowy; 6.2% abv",

We were presented with the difficult and costly purchasing of grapes to process, cellar and bottle, waiting several months to recover our costs on the finished wine. \n\nTo overcome this obstacle, we decided to bring back the historical business practice of sharecropping, resulting in the aptly named wine, “Sharecropper’s.” This partnership meant that Owen Roe would take the fruit, make the wine and once it was sold, share the profits with our growers.
