The beer’s haze comes from a combination of yeast and proteins within the malt, oats, and wheat with which it’s brewed.\n\nCenturies ago, witbiers were brewed with what Belgian farmers had on hand—namely, a large portion of wheat and oats. Un-roused, the beer will actually appear darker, as the light sediment settles to the bottom. However, once these solids are in suspension—the beer has been moved around a bit—the beer’s color lightens up to its traditional hue of pale straw. This haze also adds to the mouthfeel, giving the beer a silky, almost pillowy texture.\n\nTo experience the haze at its full potential, we encourage everyone with a bottle of Allagash White to rouse their yeast.",

Today, we still insist on using traditional methods, like triple decoction and parallel brewing in wooden lagering barrels. It takes longer but means we never compromise on our taste.\n\nPilsner Urquell’s signature flavour balances sweetness from the triple-decocted malt, and bitterness from our Saaz hops. The thick head of dense wet foam adds smoothness and seals in flavour and aroma.\n\nIn every sip of Pilsner Urquell you’ll notice a refreshing crispness from natural carbonation, then subtle caramel tones and a clean finish with a pleasing hoppy bitterness.",
