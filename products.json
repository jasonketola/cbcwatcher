    "Description": "American Pale Ale - 5.4% abv\n\nTheir flagship Pale Ale, released in 1998, is brewed with specialty malts, some grown in Maine, and four types of hops. After fermentation, it is cold conditioned and dry-hopped in lagering tanks for maximum taste and quality. It is naturally carbonated in the bottle or keg using a German process called krausening, where a small amount of fresh fermenting wort is added. This produces a delicate carbonation and superior flavor. From the Mash Tun to store shelves is a 30 day process.",
